# Project desrciption
This repository contains code for data processing for a collaborative research project with KTS and EG on regional water use rates for electricity generation in the US. Raw data for this project are available from the US Energy Information Administration Forms [860](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860/) and [923](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/) for 2014. 

This project looks at water use for electricity generation from different lifecycle perspectives as well as across different regions of the continental US. Water use is assesed from a primary energy perspective, incorporating the production, transport, processing, and conversion (excluding power plant cooling) lifecycle steps. Water use is also assesed from the electricity generation perspective, incorporating power plant cooling and combustion lifecycle steps. 

This work builds upon previous national quantification of water used for energy by EG and KTS and quantification of water use rates for electricity generating technologies by RP. Assumptions for data analysis of water embedded in primary energy used to generate electricity as well as water used during power plant operation are available on the repository Wiki.
